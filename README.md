# **🚀 Expanding My Horizons: Diving into C++ DSA for AI & ML Optimization**  

After mastering DSA in Python and delving deep into design patterns, system design, and AI/ML with Python, I’m now strengthening my foundation by learning **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C++**.  

With prior experience in **C, C++, Python, and R**, my goal is to leverage **C++ for high-performance AI/ML applications**, particularly in **OpenCV and TensorFlow**, where optimization is key.  

🔍 **Why?**  
C++ offers superior speed and memory efficiency, making it ideal for real-time processing and high-performance computing in AI/ML.  

## 📢 **To my network:**  
I’d love to hear your thoughts! Do you think mastering **C++ DSA** will significantly enhance AI/ML optimizations? Also, if you have any recommendations or insights, feel free to share. Let’s grow together! 🚀
